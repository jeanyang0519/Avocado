## Background and Overview 
Avocado is the new hot healthy superfood. You can see avocados everywhere - guacamole dips at your friend's party, delicious salads at your parents' table, and of course avocado toast at the overpriced hipster coffee shop right around the corner. 

This is the data visualization of avocado prices by time and by region in the United States, so you can see how Millenials' love of avocados impacts the price by time and what the price differences are by region.
