## Background and Overview 
Avocado is the new hot healthy superfood. You can see avocados everywhere - guacamole dips at your friend's party, delicious salads at your parents' table, and of course avocado toast at the overpriced hipster coffee shop right around the corner. 

This is the data visualization of avocado prices by time and by region in the United States, so you can see how Millenials' love of avocados impacts the price by time and what the price differences are by region. 

## Wireframes
This app will consist of a single screen with the main data display, control buttons, and footer links. The data display will include the avocado prices. At top of the screen, a drop-down will be added to the control buttons to toggle between the different data displays (by region and by time). Finally, the footer links will include my Github, LinkedIn, and Angel List.
